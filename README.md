Visualization of Global Terrorism Data Base using R.

Project can be viewed at "https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mbommas/DataScience/"

The GTD is an open source database which includes the information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2015 (45 Years).

Generated visualizations to find out the top countries which were attacked in 45 years.
Inspired by Hans Rosling's bubble plot, built a 5D dynamic motion bubble chart using gvis library(R).
Visualized the number of attacks in different continents, country wise using the Shiny library(R).
Used Excel and Python to clean the dataset.
